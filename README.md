# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game! This is a simple and fun word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word one letter at a time. This repository contains the frontend part of the Hangman Game.

## Game Concept

### How to Play

- The game starts with a hidden word represented by underscores.
- The player's objective is to guess the letters in the hidden word.
- For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn.
- The player continues guessing letters until they guess the word correctly or the hangman is fully drawn (game over).
